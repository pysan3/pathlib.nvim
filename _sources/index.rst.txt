================================

**OS independent, ultimate solution to path handling in neovim.**
=> Go to `README <README.html>`_.

This plugin aims to decrease the difficulties of path management across mutliple OSs in neovim.
The plugin API is heavily inspired by Python's `pathlib.Path` with tweaks to fit neovim usage.
It is mainly used in `neo-tree.nvim <https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim>`_
but it is very simple and portable to be used in any plugin.
